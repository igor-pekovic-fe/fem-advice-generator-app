# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app

![Design preview for the Advice generator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Readme

This challenge helped me practice my HTML, CSS and JS skills. For CSS I used SASS, and for JS I used an async...await function to fetch an API from adviceslip.com.

The challenge was a lot of fun and please feel free to give me some feedback! :)
